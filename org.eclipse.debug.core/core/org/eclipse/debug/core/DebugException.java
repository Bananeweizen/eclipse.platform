/**
 * A checked exception representing a failure.
 * <p>
 * Defines status codes relevant to the debug plug-in. When a 
 * debug exception is thrown, it contains a status object describing
 * the cause of the exception. The status objects originating from the
 * debug plug-in use the codes defined in this class.

 * Clients may instantiate this class. Clients are not intended to subclass this class.

 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
