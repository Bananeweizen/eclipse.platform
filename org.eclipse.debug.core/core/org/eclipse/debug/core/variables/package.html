<p>Defines interfaces for launch variable elements.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package defines classes and interfaces which support variable definition
  and management. These variables are intended to be used in launch
  configurations as a means of easing configuration management and making
  configurations more portable.</p>

<h4>Simple Launch Variables</h4>

<p>Simple variables are simple key/value pairs typically created and managed by the user
  via a preference page provided by the UI. Plug-in providers can also contribute simple
  launch variables via the simpleLaunchVariables extension, optionally supplying an initial
  value or a class which will generate the initial value.</p>

<h4>Context Launch Variables</h4>

<p>Context launch variables are variables whose value is computed dynamically, given
  a resource context. Typically, this context is determined by the user's selection in the UI.
  Context launch variables are contributed via the contextLaunchVariables extension.</p>
