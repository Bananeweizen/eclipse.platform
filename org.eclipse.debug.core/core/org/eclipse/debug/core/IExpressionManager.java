/**
 * The expression manager manages the collection of registered
 * expressions in the workspace. An expression is a snippet of code
 * that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expression creation
 * and evaluation are client responsibilities.
 * <p>
 * Clients interested in expression change notification may
 * register with the expression manager - see
 * <code>IExpressionListener</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
 * </p>
