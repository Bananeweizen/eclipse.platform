 * A streams proxy acts as proxy between the streams of a
 * process and interested clients. This abstraction allows
 * implementations of <code>IProcess</code> to handle I/O related
 * to the standard input, output, and error streams associated
 * with a process.
 * <p>
 * Clients implementing the <code>IProcess</code> interface must also
 * provide an implementation of this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
