/**
 * Represents a memory block.
 * 
 * When the memory block is changed, fire a CHANGE Debug Event.
 * 
 *  When firing change event, be aware of the following:
 *  - whenever a change event is fired, the content provider for Memory View / Memory Rendering
 *    view checks to see if memory has actually changed.  
 *  - If memory has actually changed, a refresh will commence.  Changes to the memory block
 *    will be computed and will be shown with the delta icons.
 *  - If memory has not changed, content will not be refreshed.  However, previous delta information 
 * 	  will be erased.  The screen will be refreshed to show that no memory has been changed.  (All
 *    delta icons will be removed.)
 * 
 * Please note that these APIs will be called multiple times by the Memory View.
 * To improve performance, debug adapters need to cache the content of its memory block and only
 * retrieve updated data when necessary.
 * @since 3.1
