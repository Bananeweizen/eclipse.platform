/**
 * A thread is a sequential flow of execution in a debug target. A
 * thread is of element type <code>THREAD</code>. A thread contains
 * stack frames.  Stack frames are only available when the thread is 
 * suspended, and are returned in top-down order.
 * Minimally, a thread supports the following capabilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>suspend/resume
 * <li>stepping
 * <li>terminate
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
