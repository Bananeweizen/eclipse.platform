/**
 * The breakpoint manager manages the collection of breakpoints
 * in the workspace. A breakpoint suspends the execution of a
 * program being debugged. The kinds of breakpoint supported by each
 * debug architecture and the information required to create those
 * breakpoints is dictated by each debug architecture.
 * Breakpoint creation is a client responsibility.
 * <p>
 * Clients interested in breakpoint change notification may
 * register with the breakpoint manager - see
 * <code>IBreakpointListener</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
 * </p>
