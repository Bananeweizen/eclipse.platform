<h1>3.0 Debug Platform Change Notes</h1>
<p>This document describes important changes in the 3.0 debug platform, relative 
  to the 2.1 release.</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<h3> Extensible Launch Modes</h3>
<p>The debug platform supports an extensible set of launch modes. Releases prior 
  to 3.0 only supported two launch modes - run and debug. The debug platform now 
  provides an extension point for contributing new launch modes - <code>org.eclipse.debug.core.launchModes</code>. 
  The debug platform now defines (contributes) three basic launch modes - run, 
  debug, and profile. Other clients may contribute new launch modes. The launch 
  manager (<code>ILaunchManager</code>) has additional API to retrieve all launch 
  modes, and a human readable label for each launch mode.</p>
<p>The debug platform has a new extension point to support the contribution of 
  a launch delegate for a specific launch configuration type and launch mode - 
  <code>org.eclipse.debug.core.launchDelegates</code>. This allows launch configurations 
  to be extended by third parties, to support new launch modes. For example, a 
  client could contribute a launch delegate that launches a Java Application in 
  profile mode (currently, the SDK does not provide a profiler).</p>
<p>The debug platform has added an optional element (<code>launchMode</code>), 
  to the definition of a launch tab group extension - <code>(org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchConfigurationTabGroup</code>), 
  to support the contribution of a set of tabs for a specific launch configuration 
  type and launch mode. This allows third parties to extend an existing lauch 
  configuration user interface. For example, a client contributing a launch delegate 
  to profile a Java Application would also contribute a set of tabs to configure 
  the profiler. The launchMode element defines a perpsective attribute to specify 
  the default perspective assocaited with the launch configuration type and mode. 
  This controls the perspective that is switched to/opened, by default, when a 
  configuration is launched in the associated mode. For example, a client contributing 
  a profiler may also contribute a profiling perspective that should be displayed 
  when an application is profiled.</p>
