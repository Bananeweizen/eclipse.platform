<h1>3.0 Debug Platform Change Notes</h1>
<p>This document describes important changes in the 3.0 debug platform, relative 
  to the 2.1 release.</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<h3> Extensible Launch Modes</h3>
<p>The debug platform supports an extensible set of launch modes. Releases prior 
  to 3.0 only supported two launch modes - run and debug. The debug platform now 
  provides an extension point for contributing new launch modes - <code>org.eclipse.debug.core.launchModes</code>. 
  The debug platform now defines (contributes) three basic launch modes - run, 
  debug, and profile. Other clients may contribute new launch modes. The launch 
  manager (<code>ILaunchManager</code>) has additional API to retrieve all launch 
  modes, and a human readable label for each launch mode.</p>
<p>The debug platform has a new extension point to support the contribution of 
  a launch delegate for a specific launch configuration type and launch mode - 
  <code>org.eclipse.debug.core.launchDelegates</code>. This allows launch configurations 
  to be extended by third parties, to support new launch modes. For example, a 
  client could contribute a launch delegate that launches a Java Application in 
  profile mode (currently, the SDK does not provide a profiler).</p>
<p>For backwards compatibility, the launch delegate supplied by a launch configuration 
  type extension is used for the launch modes specified by the launch configuration 
  type. A launch delegate supplied for a specific mode, is used only for that 
  mode. </p>
<p>The debug platform has added an optional element (<code>launchMode</code>), 
  to the definition of a launch tab group extension - <code>(org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchConfigurationTabGroup</code>), 
  to support the contribution of a set of tabs for a specific launch configuration 
  type and launch mode. This allows third parties to extend an existing lauch 
  configuration user interface. For example, a client contributing a launch delegate 
  to profile a Java Application would also contribute a set of tabs to configure 
  the profiler. The launchMode element defines a perpsective attribute to specify 
  the default perspective assocaited with the launch configuration type and mode. 
  This controls the perspective that is switched to/opened, by default, when a 
  configuration is launched in the associated mode. For example, a client contributing 
  a profiler may also contribute a profiling perspective that should be displayed 
  when an application is profiled.</p>
<p>For backwards compatibility, the tab group contributed for a launch confiugration 
  type (specifying no launch mode), is used for all launch modes for which a specific 
  launch tab group is not contributed. Thus, when a mode is not specified by a 
  tab group, the tab group effectively becomes the default tab group.</p>
<h3>Extensible Debug Events</h3>
<p>The debug platform supports an extensible set of debug events. A debug event 
  kind of <code>MODEL_SPECIFIC</code> has been added in the 3.0 release to indicate 
  an application specific debug event. When a debug event of kind <code>MODEL_SPECIFIC</code> 
  is created, the detail code in the event is client defined. The source of the 
  event (debug element that generated the event) identifies the debug model from 
  which the event was generated. The debug platform and user interface ignores 
  model specific debug events.</p>
<p>A data field has been added to debug events to allow clients to store application 
  specific data in debug events.</p>
<h3>Extensible Instruction Pointer Images</h3>
<p>When a stack frame is selected in the debug view, the debugger opens a corresponding 
  editor and displays an image in the editor ruler on the line that corresponds 
  to the selected stack frame. In releases prior to 3.0, the images were provided 
  by the debug plug-in and could not be overridden by a debug model. In release 
  3.0, a debug model presentation (<code>IDebugModelPresentation</code>) can provide 
  specialized images by implementing the debug editor presentation interface (<code>IDebugEditorPresentation</code>).</p>
<h2>API Changes</h2>
<h3>Extensible Launch Modes</h3>
<p>With the introduction of extensible launch modes, more than one launch delegate 
  can exist for a launch configuration type. Releases prior to 3.0 only supported 
  one launch delegate per launch configuration type. The method <code>ILaunchConfigurationType.getDelegate()</code> 
  is now deprecated. The method <code>getDelegate(String mode)</code> should be 
  used in its place to retrieve the launch delegate for a specific launch mode. 
  The deprecated method has been changed to return the launch delegate for the 
  <code>run</code> mode.</p>
