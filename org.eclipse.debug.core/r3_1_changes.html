<h1>3.1 Debug Platform Change Notes</h1>
<p>This document describes new features and important changes in the 3.1 debug 
  platform, relative to the 3.0 release.</p>
  
<h2>New Features</h2>

<h3> Breakpoint Organizers</h3>
<p>The breakpoints view allows breakpoints to be displayed in groups. The platform 
  supports breakpoint groupings by breakpoint type, file, project, and breakpoint 
  working sets and resource based working sets (as well, it supports nested groupings). 
  The <code>breakpointOrganizers</code> extension point allows for other grouping 
  strategies to be contributed to the debug platform.</p>
<p>An new, optional, <code>name</code> attribute has been added to the breakpoints 
  extension point to provide a type name for breakpoints. This name appears as 
  the group label, when the user chooses to group breakpoints by type. If this 
  attribute is not specified on a breakpoint extension, the breakpoints are considered 
  to not have a type, and will be displayed in the &quot;Others&quot; group.</p>
<h3>Logical Structure Providers</h3>
<p>Logical structures have been enhanced to allow clients to more easily contribute 
  more than one logical structure for a given value. The new extension point <code>logicalStructureProviders</code> 
  allows clients to contribute an implementation of an <code>ILogicalStrugureProvider</code>. 
  A logical structure provider provides a simple way to contribute a single factory 
  of logical structures for a debug model.</p>
<p>In addition the optional interface <code>ILogicalStructureTypeDelegate2</code> 
  has been added to allow a logical structure delegate to provide a dynamic label 
  for a value's logical structure type.</p>
<h3>Process Console Enhancements</h3>
<p>The debug console has been enhanced to allow output to be multiplexed between 
  the console and/or a file. As well, the encoding used to translate output to 
  characters is now specifiable. All of these options are available to the user 
  on the &quot;Common&quot; launch configuration tab. As well, the options are 
  available programmatically as launch configuration attributes. The following 
  attributes have been added to <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.IDebugUIConstants</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>ATTR_CONSOLE_ENCODING</code></li>
  <li><code>ATTR_CAPTURE_IN_CONSOLE</code></li>
  <li><code>ATTR_CAPTURE_IN_FILE</code></li>
  <li><code>ATTR_APPEND_TO_FILE</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Memory View</h3>
<p>The Memory view, which was first released in 3.0 as internal API, has become 
  public API in 3.1. See the new extension point <code>memoryRenderings</code>, 
  and the new API package <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.memory</code> for more information.</p>
<h3>Parse Arguments</h3>
<p>DebugPlugin.parseArguments(..)</p>
<h3>Run To Line Handler</h3>
<h3>Run To Line Action Delegate</h3>
<p>can also be contributed to a view</p>
<h3>Variable Value Editors</h3>
<h3>Launch Shortcut Keybindings</h3>
<p>To register a key-binding for a launch shortcut, define a command with an <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">id 
  </font>the same as the launch shortcut <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">id</font>, 
  suffixed with the launch mode. For example, the id of the &quot;Java Application&quot; 
  launch short cut is <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.localJavaShortcut</font>, 
  so the command id for launching in debug mode is <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.localJavaShortcut.debug</font>. 
  Then define a key-binding for your command.</p>
<p>When the command is invoked via the key-binding, the selection or active editor 
  will be used as the target for the launch shortcut's launch method. The shortcut 
  is only invoked if the shortcut is enabled for the selection or editor.</p>
<h3>Source Lookup/Display Facility</h3>
<h3>Watchpoints (IWatchpoint) and images</h3>
<h3>Colors and Fonts for debug elements</h3>
<h3>Inserting elements into debug view/hierarchy</h3>
<h3>Abstract Debug Element</h3>
<h3>Drop to Frame Platform Action/Interface</h3>
<h3>Launch from context menu in editor</h3>
<p>Editor input must have an ILaunchable adapter for this to work.</p>
<h3>Support for hidden launch (unregistered)</h3>
<p>new launch method and ILaunchManager.isRegistered(..)</p>
<h3>Reuseable breakpoint ruler toggle actions</h3>
<h3>Environment variables case preservation</h3>
<h3>Memory block extensions and Memory View</h3>
<h3>IStreamsProxy2</h3>
<h3>LaunchConfigurationDelegate#getBreakpoints(..)</h3>
<p>allows to check if there are relevant breakpoints in the workspace for a launch</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<h3>Debug Event Dispatch</h3>
<p>Debug event set listeners are notified of fired debug events asynchronously 
  in a different thread than the event is reported in.</p>
<h3>Debug Actions in Background</h3>
<h3>Background Content Providers/Workbench adapters</h3>
<p>Note: debug elements must subclass PlatformObject for adapter mechanism to 
  work. </p>
<h3>Contextual launch from top level Run/Debug menus</h3>
<p>The top level menus no longer support the perspective element, and launch shortcuts 
  must specify a &quot;contextualLaunch&quot; element to appear in the Run/Debug 
  casecade menus.</p>
