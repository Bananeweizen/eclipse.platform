<h1>Eclipse Team and CVS 3.0 Test Plan</h1>
This plan contains a detailed listing of the features available in the
Eclipse CVS plug-in. There are some items that don't have many steps
but are meant as a reminder that the features exist and should be
tested. If you want to help, please feel free to hammer away on some
bits of functionality.<br>
<br>
For a more verbose explanation of the CVS plug-in please refer to our
documentation.<br>
<h2>CVS Server Versions</h2>
We focus our testing on the latest stable *nix server version. We will
however sniff test the latest developer *nix server and the cvsnt
server. In addition, we will run our automated tests on all three
flavours. The current server lineup is:<br>
<br>
Latest Stable: <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.11.16</span><br>
Latest Development: <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.12.8</span><br>
CVS NT: <strong>2.0.41a</strong>

<p>You should be able to create a repo connection from the toolbar of the view or via the context menu. Try expanding, searching for branches. Also, 
try the failures cases from <a href="html/connections00001.html">Connections</a>.
Things to try:
<ul>
<li>Create repo locations for different connection types: ext, pserver, extssh.
<li>Expanding project nodes should process the children in the background and the view should remain responsive while this is happening. When children nodes are added to the 
tree the tree shouldn't be too jumpy.

<h2>Reconnecting an existing project</h2>
<p>Since: 3.0 M6<br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2004/05/31 20:01:23 $</p>
<p>
The following scenario represents how a user would reconnect a project that does
not contain CVS meta-data to it's remote counterpart. It is assumed that the local project 
was derived from a previous version of the remote project but both the local project and
the remote may have been modified since then.
</p>
<h3>Scenario 1: Existing location using project name</h3>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Load an existing project (using Checkout or you could import a plug-in project from the target area)</li>
  <li>Disconnect the project and indicate that CVS meta-data is to be deleted</li>
  <li>Modify some local resources</li>
  <li>Optionally, modify the remote contents of some resources using a separate checkout</li>
  <li>Perform a Team>Share Project and select CVS (if there is more than one 
  repository provider available).</li>
  <li>Select the repository the project was loaded from and click Next.</li>
  <li>Use the project name as the module name. Click Next.</li>
  <li>In the tag page, select HEAD as the branch to share with and click Next</li>
  <li>In the sharing page, only the files that do not have the same contents
  as the server should appear. Perform a Mark as Merged or Commit on these 
  files.
  <li>Click Finish.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Scenario 1: New location using curstom module name</h3>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Load an existing project using Checkout As and a different name</li>
  <li>Disconnect the project and indicate that CVS meta-data is to be deleted</li>
  <li>Discard the repository location<li>
  <li>Modify some local resources</li>
  <li>Optionally, modify the remote contents of some resources using a separate checkout</li>
  <li>Perform a Team>Share Project and select CVS (if there is more than one 
  repository provider available).</li>
  <li>Select to create a new repository and click Next</li>
  <li>Enter the repository information for the repository and click Next</li>
  <li>Enter the name of the module that the project was loaded from. Click Next.</li>

Last Modified: $Date: 2004/03/15 22:00:31 $</p>
<p>
You should be able to select a project/folder/resource and compare againts
another branch or version. Multi-select should work across projects in 
different repositories. Once the comparison is shown it should be possible to
merge changes into the local workspace. It should also be possible to remember 
the comparison, which will cause it to appear in the synchronize view.</p>
<p>
We should support multi-selection of files, but I'm not sure what should be
shown to the user in those cases.</p>
<h3>On file selected</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the file has differences open a compare editor and show otherwise a message is shown to indicate that the file is the same.
<li>should be able to open the history view and link in to the opened compare editor
<li>the compare editor should update when changes are made to the local file in some other context (e.g other editor, refactoring).
</ul>

<h3>Multiple selection</h3>
<p>Entire contents of the folder are compared deep. If changes are found the user is notified and they are
shown in a dialog. If no changes are found the user is notified. The dialog should allow the user to browse
the changes and merge anything into his workspace. If the user wants to keep the comparison non-model, he
can add it to the synchronize view. There is a button to do so on the compare dialog.</p>

<h3>Merging changes</h3>
<p>
When the compare dialog is showing several changes you should be able to selectively merge anything into the local workspace. Specific attention should
be made to the following cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the local then press ok. You should be prompted to save the changes and the changes should be correctly updated in the corresponding resource.
<li>Edit the local and browse to another file. You should be prompted to save the changes.
<li>Press the cancel button with changes, you should be prompted.

<h2>Performing a Synchronize</h2>

<p>
Synchronizing means to compare your local workspace contents with the contents 
in another location with the goal that the two locations should contain the
same contents at some point.
</p>

<h3>Performing a Synchronize operation</h3>
<p>
There are a few ways of launching a synchronize operation. They all open the same dialog but the initial
selection is affected by where the operation is launched. Here is the list of ways to start a 
synchronize along with the expected initial selection.
<ul>
<li><b>Using the global synchronize action (via toolbar or keybinding)</b>: The 
selection should be obtained from the active view. If no view is active, all
prjects should be selected.
<li><b>Using the Synchronize button in toolbar of the Synchronize view</b>: 
All projects should be selected.
<li><b>Selecting Synchronize from the context menu of resources in the synchronize view</b>:
The selection should match what was selected when the menu was selected.
<li><b>Selecting Team > Synchronize with Repository from the context menu of any resource based view</b>:
The selection should match what was selected when the menu was selected.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once launched, a synchronize will run in the background. Currently, the user is prompted to 
switch perspectives when the synchronize is launched. When a synchronize completes, the user is prompted either with a dialog stating there is no changes
or one that contains a details area that shows the incoming changes. The user
is given the option to supress the post-synchronize dialog.

<h3>Notice a file is out-of-sync in another view (e.g. packages explorer, types) and want to see the changes</h3>
<p>In case you can select a file, it will be refreshed with the server, and if changes are found the compare editor is opened
that will allow browsing the changes. If no changes are found, you will be prompted.</p>

<h3>From another view would like to browse the outgoing/incoming changes for several resources</h3>
<p>Select a folder or group of files and Team > Synchronize will open the sync view and automatically refresh with
the remote repository.</p>

<h3>In the sync view and would like to refresh to see if there are new changes from the server</h3>
<p>

</p>

Assumption, the sync view may or may not be open when the synchronize is performed. Maybe we need a different prompt
each case. One for Team > Sync and another for refresh from the sync view.

<h2>Decorations</h2>
<p>Since: M8<br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2004/03/17 14:30:32 $</p>

There are many standard decorations in the sync view. Most significant are the propagated flags.

<h3>Conflicts</h3>
<p>
Conflicting changes should be propagated to parent resources such that you can easily see, when the tree
is collapsed that there are conflicts. When the conflict is resolved, the parent conflict markers should be
removed.
</p>
<h3>Error and Warning problem markers</h3>
<p>
Error and warning makers are shown on resources and propagated to parent resources such that you can
easily see if you are releasing errors or warnings.
</p>
<h3>Branch changes</h3>
<p>
Changes to branches, revisions, should be updated automatically in the views decorators. For example, if you branch 
from the sync view the branch name should appear.

CVS text label decorations should be visible in the CVS synchronize participants. We don't bother to show
the images because the sync view already shows the state images. The labels should also update if the
'show change in label' preference is changed.

Also, in the CVS synchronize view the revisions shown are the <local> - <remote>. So ensure that the correct

<h2>Timings</h2>
<p>Since: 3.0<br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2004/06/01 13:53:59 $</p>

This section contains various timing results and comparisons.

<h3>Overview</h3>

The purpose of this section is to provide a small set of tests that can 
be used to benchmark the Eclipse CVS client. The areas tested are:

<ol>
<li>Checkout
<li>Synchronizing
<li>Updating
</ol>

<h3>Setup</h3>

The following should be considered when obtaining timings:

<ul>
<li>The Progress view in verbose mode can add 20% or more to times. 
In regular mode, it can still add a bit to the time. For these timings,
the view was open but hidden.
<li>The Console view can add as much as 20% to times. For these tests,
the console was turned off entirely.
<li>Running an eclipse operation several times will "warm-up" the code path
due to JIT. The timings for Eclipse were usually the secodn or third
timing obtained.
</ul>

The following numbers were obtained on a 2.8GHz PC running GTK, Sun 14.2
with autobuild off and operations run in the forground. The project used was 
org.eclipse.jdt.tests.refactoring. It has a large number of folders and files 
which give interesting times. The date the timings were obtained were May 31st, 2004
so similar numbers can be obtained for comparison using the project snapshot at that time 
(which can be obtained using a Date tag).

<h3>Checkout</h3>

Checkout of org.eclipse.jdt.tests.refactoring as of 2004/05/31. The timings are
in "mm:ss" and were obtained by obervation (i.e. stopwatch).

<ul>
<li>Eclipse 3.0 over pserver: 3:00 to 3:30 (several timings)
<ul>
<li>Timings increased slightly with progress view visible and considerably
with progress view in verbose mode.
</ul>
<li>CLI over pserver: 3:00 (1 timing)
</ul>

<h3>Synchronize</h3>

Synchronizing of org.eclipse.jdt.tests.refactoring as of 2004/05/31. The timings are
in "mm:ss" and were obtained by obervation (i.e. stopwatch).

<h4>Synchronize with no changes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse 3.0 over pserver: 0:45
<li>CLI over pserver: 0:42 ("cvs -n update")
</ul>

<h4>Synchronize with all outgoing, no incoming</h4>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse 3.0 over pserver: 1:00
<li>CLI over pserver: 2:20 ("cvs -n update")
</ul>

<h4>Synchronize with incoming changes</h4>

Incoming changes were simulated by loading version v20040106 and
then removing the tag (using a special utility action). This resulted 
in 393 incoming changes.

<ul>
<li>Eclipse 3.0 over pserver: 0:55
<li>CLI over pserver: 0:45 ("cvs -n update")
</ul>

The timing for Eclipse also includes the status command to fetch the revisions for the 393 incoming changes.

<h3>Update</h3>

These timings were obtained using Team>Update for Eclipse and "cvs update ." for the CLI.

<h4>Update with no changes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse 3.0 over pserver: 1:15, 1:25 (2 timings)
<li>CLI over pserver: 1:15 ("cvs update")
</ul>

<h4>Update with all false outgoing changes (using touch) </h4>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse 3.0 over pserver: 2:20
<li>CLI over pserver: 2:20
</ul>

<h4>Update with incoming changes</h4>

Incoming changes were simulated by loading version v20040106 and
then removing the tag (using a special utility action). This resulted 
in 393 incoming changes.

<ul>
<li>Eclipse 3.0 over pserver: 1:55
<li>CLI over pserver: 1:55 ("cvs -n update")
</ul>

<h2>Resource Data Structures</h2>
<p>Since: 3.0<br>
Last Modified: $Date: 2004/06/01 13:53:59 $</p>

This section contains results on memory footprint of CVS in the Core resource
plugin data structures. More specifically, CVS uses the session and persistant property
caches along with the synchronizer.

<h3>CVS Workspace Sync info caches</h3>

Checking of the cahce usage requires the use of the Core spy tools. To
obtain the memory footprint, perform the following steps.

<ol>
<li>Install the Core Spy Tools
<li>Launch Eclipse
<li>Checkout several projects
<li>Open the Element Tree Spy to get the memory footprint. At the
time of writting, CVS is the main user of these structures. In future
test, ensure that others are not contributing to the tally.
<li>Disconnect all the projects
<li>The Element Tree Spy memory footprint should be reduced accordingly
</ol>

The following snapshot of the resource element tree was taken after checking out all of the projects
(294 as of 2004/05/31) in dev.eclipse.org.

<h3>CVS Merge memory usage</h3>
Merging in CVS makes use of the Core synchronizer. Perform the following steps 
with the Core Spy Tool installed to
ensure proper memory management.

<ol>
<li>Checkout one or more projects
<li>Open the Element Tree Spy to get the memory footprint. 
<li>Perform a merge
<li>Open the Element Tree Spy to get the memory footprint. The only increase
should be in the synchronizer.
<li>Remove the merge from the sync view
<li>The Element Tree Spy memory footprint should be reduced accordingly

The Team component provides several data strucutures that can be used to 
cache resource synchronization state and resource variants for improved 
performance. The plan is to provide tools to interogate these caches in the 3.1 timeframe.

These caches include:

<ul>
<li>Resource Variant cache
<li>SubsciberParticipant/SyncInfoSet
</ul>

<h3>CVS Specific data structures</h3>

CVS uses several caches to improve performance. Tools should be provided to query the
size of these caches as well.

<ul>
<li>Console (caches contents while not visible)
<li>Resource History View log entry cache
<li>Commit Sets log entry cache
