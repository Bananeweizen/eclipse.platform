<h1>Eclipse Team and CVS 3.0 Test Plan</h1>
This plan contains a detailed listing of the features available in the
Eclipse CVS plug-in. There are some items that don't have many steps
but are meant as a reminder that the features exist and should be
tested. If you want to help, please feel free to hammer away on some
bits of functionality.<br>
<br>
For a more verbose explanation of the CVS plug-in please refer to our
documentation.<br>
<h2>CVS Server Versions</h2>
We focus our testing on the latest stable *nix server version. We will
however sniff test the latest developer *nix server and the cvsnt
server. In addition, we will run our automated tests on all three
flavours. The current server lineup is:<br>
<br>
Latest Stable: <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.11.16</span><br>
Latest Development: <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.12.8</span><br>
CVS NT: <strong>2.0.41a</strong>

<h4>Compare With... in Repositories view </h4>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a project in HEAD and choose Compare With... from context menu</li>
  <li>Select a branch tag</li>
  <li>Ensure result of comparison is correct</li>
  <li>Repeat and in step 2) use a version tag</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat the above steps for a project in a branch and a project version.</p>
<p>Repeat the above steps for a selected folder and a selected file.</p>
<h4>Compare on two selections in Repositories view</h4>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a project in HEAD</li>
  <li>CTRL-select a project in a branch</li>
  <li>Choose Compare from context menu</li>
  <li>Ensure result of comparison is correct</li>

  <p>Repeat the above steps for a selected folder and a selected file.</p>
<h4>Compare on two selections in Resource History view.</h4>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Resource History view on a file with multiple revisions</li>
  <li>Select 2 and choose Compare from the context menu</li>
  <li>Ensure result of comparison is correct</li>
</ul>


<a name="00039.html">

<p>
You should be able to select a project/folder/resource and compare againts
another branch or version. Multi-select should work across projects in 
different repositories. Once the comparison is shown it should be possible to
merge changes into the local workspace. It should also be possible to remember 
the comparison, which will cause it to appear in the synchronize view.</p>
<p>
We should support multi-selection of files, but I'm not sure what should be
shown to the user in those cases.</p>
<h3>On file selected</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the file has differences open a compare editor and show otherwise a message is shown to indicate that the file is the same.
<li>should be able to open the history view and link in to the opened compare editor
<li>the compare editor should update when changes are made to the local file in some other context (e.g other editor, refactoring).
</ul>

<h3>Multiple selection</h3>
<p>Entire contents of the folder are compared deep. If changes are found the user is notified and they are
shown in a dialog. If no changes are found the user is notified. The dialog should allow the user to browse
the changes and merge anything into his workspace. If the user wants to keep the comparison non-model, he
can add it to the synchronize view. There is a button to do so on the compare dialog.</p>

<h3>Merging changes</h3>
<p>
When the compare dialog is showing several changes you should be able to selectively merge anything into the local workspace. Specific attention should
be made to the following cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the local then press ok. You should be prompted to save the changes and the changes should be correctly updated in the corresponding resource.
<li>Edit the local and browse to another file. You should be prompted to save the changes.
<li>Press the cancel button with changes, you should be prompted.
</ul>

<a name="00040.html">


You should be able to restore a deleted revision from the CVS server.

<h3>CVS QuickDiff</h3>
<p>Enable CVS quick diff for text and java files via the Workbench > Editors > QuickDiff preference. Then try the following
scenarios.</p>

<ol>

<li>Open a file and make changes to it. You will see the quickdiff annotations
marking the changes. Next, run Team > Replace with latest. The annotations are
removed and the file is clean.

<li>same as 1 but this time instead commit the file. The quickdiff annotations
are removed and the file is clean.

<li>checkout two copies of the same project. Open file1 from both projects. Make
changes to file1 in project1 and commit the change. Synchronize project2 and
file1 from project1 will show the quickdiff annotations for the new incoming
changes.

<li> same as previous but this time actually update the file. The files quickdiff
annotations are removed and the file is clean.

<p>
Synchronizing means to compare your local workspace contents with the contents 
in another location with the goal that the two locations should contain the
same contents at some point.
</p>

<h3>Performing a Synchronize operation</h3>
<p>
There are a few ways of launching a synchronize operation. They all open the same dialog but the initial
selection is affected by where the operation is launched. Here is the list of ways to start a 
synchronize along with the expected initial selection.
<ul>
<li><b>Using the global synchronize action (via toolbar or keybinding)</b>: The 
selection should be obtained from the active view. If no view is active, all
prjects should be selected.
<li><b>Using the Synchronize button in toolbar of the Synchronize view</b>: 
All projects should be selected.
<li><b>Selecting Synchronize from the context menu of resources in the synchronize view</b>:
The selection should match what was selected when the menu was selected.
<li><b>Selecting Team > Synchronize with Repository from the context menu of any resource based view</b>:
The selection should match what was selected when the menu was selected.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once launched, a synchronize will run in the background. Currently, the user is prompted to 
switch perspectives when the synchronize is launched. When a synchronize completes, the user is prompted either with a dialog stating there is no changes
or one that contains a details area that shows the incoming changes. The user
is given the option to supress the post-synchronize dialog.

<h3>Notice a file is out-of-sync in another view (e.g. packages explorer, types) and want to see the changes</h3>
<p>In case you can select a file, it will be refreshed with the server, and if changes are found the compare editor is opened
that will allow browsing the changes. If no changes are found, you will be prompted.</p>

<h3>From another view would like to browse the outgoing/incoming changes for several resources</h3>
<p>Select a folder or group of files and Team > Synchronize will open the sync view and automatically refresh with
the remote repository.</p>

<h3>In the sync view and would like to refresh to see if there are new changes from the server</h3>
<p>

</p>

Assumption, the sync view may or may not be open when the synchronize is performed. Maybe we need a different prompt
each case. One for Team > Sync and another for refresh from the sync view.


<a name="00049.html">


There are many standard decorations in the sync view. Most significant are the propagated flags.

<h3>Conflicts</h3>
<p>
Conflicting changes should be propagated to parent resources such that you can easily see, when the tree
is collapsed that there are conflicts. When the conflict is resolved, the parent conflict markers should be
removed.
</p>
<h3>Error and Warning problem markers</h3>
<p>
Error and warning makers are shown on resources and propagated to parent resources such that you can
easily see if you are releasing errors or warnings.
</p>
<h3>Branch changes</h3>
<p>
Changes to branches, revisions, should be updated automatically in the views decorators. For example, if you branch 
from the sync view the branch name should appear.

<li>Test mark as merged (ensure that it can work on large data sets
</ul>

<a name="00022.html">


<h3>Scenario 1: Merge in Dialog</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select a project and perform a Team>Merge.
<li>Choose the start and end tags in the wizard and finish.
<li>The merge will run in the background.
<li>Upon completion, the user is presented with a dialog of the incoming changes.
<li>Update the incoming changes and ensure they worked.
</ol>

<p>After updating, reperform the same merge. A no-changes dialog should be 
presented since the local contents match the end-poimt.

<h3>Scenario 1: Merge in Synchronize view</h3>

<ol>
<li>Perform the previous scenario except for the last step
<li>Choose to remember the merge 
<li>Ensure that the merge appears in the Synchronize View
<li>Exit and restart eclipse
<li>The merge should still exist in the Synchronize View
<li>Update to the incoming changes.
<li>Optionally release new changes to the merge endpoint and refresh the merge. 
The new updates should appear.
<li>Delete the merge from the synchronize view using the remove toolbar button
<li>The merge subscriber should be removed from the view.

    changes and be one of the later ones in the refresh order (alphebetical).</li>
  <li>Turn on CVS decorators</li>
  <li>As the decorations are being calculated, disconnect all projects from CVS 
    control.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the project is removed from the sync view and no errors occur</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat the above steps but change the operation in step 5) to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>close project</li>
  <li>project where server is unreachable</li>
  <li>delete project</li>
  <li>binary project import over source project with outgoing changes</li>
  <li>delete or move files and folders (to test move/delete hook)</li>
</ul>



<h1>Restarting Workbench</h1>
<a name="00019.html">


<p>Scenario 1</p>
<ol>
  <li>Turn on deep dirty decoration</li>
  <li>Dirty a file and ensure that the file and it's parents are dirty</li>
  <li>Quit Eclipse so dirty state is persisted</li>
  <li>Restart and perform an override and update or commit and ensure file and 
    parents are clean</li>
  <li>Kill Eclipse</li>
  <li>Restart and ensure parents and file are clean</li>
</ol>
<p>Scenario 2</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check out two copies of the same project</li>
  <li>Dirty the same file in both projects, commit one and refresh the other in 
    the sync view so a conflict is visible</li>
  <li>Quit Eclipse so that the sync state is persisted</li>
  <li>Restart Eclipse and perform an Override and Commit on the conflict</li>
  <li>Kill Eclipse</li>
  <li>Restart Eclipse and ensure that the sync view doesn't show the file (i.e 
    the file is in-sync).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Saved between sessions</h4>
<p>The following GUI preferences in the Synchronize View are persisted between workbench 
sessions. Also they are persisted for each participant. You should be able to create
a merge and workspace participant, then change the settings on each. Restart Eclipse and the settings 
should be maintained for each participant. The persisted settings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>mode
<li>layout
<li>working set
</ul>

<h1>Patching</h1>
<a name="00030.html">


<p>This scenario captures one means of patching. It assumes that a zip file contains 
a previous version of a project that has been modified in some way and added to
a zip archive (without CVS directories).</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Load the project from CVS (using Checkout or some other means)</li>
  <li>Import the zip over the loaded project.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the sync states are Outgoing for all resources from the zip file.</li>
  <li>Ensure that all folders from the zip file (except new ones)
  are marked as in-sync and all files (except new ones) are outgoing changes.
  <li>Changing the comparison criteria to compare contents should not contact the server
  and should leave only the resources that differ in the sync view. Perform a 
  Mark As Merged and a Commit on these resources.</li>
  <li>Changing the comparison criteria back to revision number will reveal all the files
  whose content did not change, perform a Mark as merged on these resources followed by 
  a Team>Update on the project in the Navigator (Note: This could be handled better).</li>
  <li>After the update, ensure the project has no out-of-sync resources.</li>
</ol>


<h1>SSH2</h1>
<a name="00029a.html">


This test is to ensure that the ssh2 connection method properly delagates to ssh1
when the server only supports ssh1. 


<a name="00030a.html">


Using HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies.


<a name="00031.html">


You should be able to generate private/public keys in the SSH2 preference
page. Here are some scenarios for testing:
<ul>
<li>Generate keys and save private key without password. You should be prompted.
<li>Generate keys and save private key with password. You shouldn't be prompted.
<li>Generate keys and install using the sftp button.
</ul>

<a name="00032.html">


This tests the prompting and usage of the SSH2 connection method:
<ul>
<li>Delete all files in your SSH_HOME directory. You can find this directory by opening the SSH2 preference page
<li>Create a CVS repository connection of type 'extssh'. You will be prompting about the server id not being in 
your known_hosts file.
<li>Select cancel, and error should be shown indicating that the location was not validated do you want to keep it.
</ul>

CVS text label decorations should be visible in the CVS synchronize participants. We don't bother to show
the images because the sync view already shows the state images. The labels should also update if the
'show change in label' preference is changed.
</p>
<p>
Also, in the CVS synchronize view the revisions shown are the <local> - <remote>. So ensure that the correct
remote is shown.</p>

<h3>Replace the local resource with other revisions</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the file isn't managed the action should no appear.
<li>If the file doesn't have any revisions you should be prompted
<li>If the file has revisions you should be prompted with the list of revisions in a compare dialog
<li>In the compare dialog you can select any revision and compare changes but merging isn't supported
<li>If a revision is selected the Replace button should be enabled. Otherwise it should be disabled
<li>If you selected the replace button the file should contain the contents of the revision selected. The dialog will also close.
<li>Ensure that the titles are ok (e.g. dialog title, structure pane title...)
