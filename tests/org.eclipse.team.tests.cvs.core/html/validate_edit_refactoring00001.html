These tests are a sanity check that workbench, JDT and other tools refactorings behave 
properly with respect to validate Edit. For a repository providers that supports
a pessimistic workflow, the following scenarios should result in the invocation
of the validate edit callback and should include a UI context which allows prompting.
<p>
The following scenarios are stated in terms of the Navigator view and JDT. Other tools
should translate them to a set of scenarios that make sense for the tool.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<h3>S1: Search and Replace</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select one or more projects or folders and choose Search/File.
<li>Enter a string known to exist in multiple files and click Replace
<li>Enter a new string that differs from the one searched for.
</ol>
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<h3>S2: Single file content modification</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open a Java file that is read-only
<li>Perform any of the Java Source operations (e.g. toggle comment)
<li>Ensure that validate edit is invoked
</ol>
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<h3>S3: Multiple file content modification</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ensure all files in your workspace are read-only
<li>Perform a Java/Refactoring such as a method or class rename.
<li>Ensure that validate edit is invoked at most once per project involved.
</ol>
