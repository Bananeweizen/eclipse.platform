Synchronizing means to compare your local workspace contents with the contents 
in another location with the goal that the two locations should contain the
same contents at some point.
</p>

<h3>Performing a Synchronize operation</h3>
<p>
There are a few ways of launching a synchronize operation. They all open the same dialog but the initial
selection is affected by where the operation is launched. Here is the list of ways to start a 
synchronize along with the expected initial selection.
<ul>
<li><b>Using the global synchronize action (via toolbar or keybinding)</b>: The 
selection should be obtained from the active view. If no view is active, all
prjects should be selected.
<li><b>Using the Synchronize button in toolbar of the Synchronize view</b>: 
All projects should be selected.
<li><b>Selecting Synchronize from the context menu of resources in the synchronize view</b>:
The selection should match what was selected when the menu was selected.
<li><b>Selecting Team > Synchronize with Repository from the context menu of any resource based view</b>:
The selection should match what was selected when the menu was selected.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once launched, a synchronize will run in the background. Currently, the user is prompted to 
switch perspectives when the synchronize is launched. When a synchronize completes, the user is prompted either with a dialog stating there is no changes
or one that contains a details area that shows the incoming changes. The user
is given the option to supress the post-synchronize dialog.

<h3>Notice a file is out-of-sync in another view (e.g. packages explorer, types) and want to see the changes</h3>
<p>In case you can select a file, it will be refreshed with the server, and if changes are found the compare editor is opened
that will allow browsing the changes. If no changes are found, you will be prompted.</p>

<h3>From another view would like to browse the outgoing/incoming changes for several resources</h3>
<p>Select a folder or group of files and Team > Synchronize will open the sync view and automatically refresh with
the remote repository.</p>

<h3>In the sync view and would like to refresh to see if there are new changes from the server</h3>
<p>

</p>

Assumption, the sync view may or may not be open when the synchronize is performed. Maybe we need a different prompt
each case. One for Team > Sync and another for refresh from the sync view.
