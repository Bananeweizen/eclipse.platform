You should be able to select a project/folder/resource and compare againts
another branch or version. Multi-select should work across projects in 
different repositories. Once the comparison is shown it should be possible to
merge changes into the local workspace.</p>
<p>
We should support multi-selection of files, but I'm not sure what should be
shown to the user in those cases.</p>
