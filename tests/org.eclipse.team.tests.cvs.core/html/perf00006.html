The Team component provides several data strucutures that can be used to 
cache resource synchronization state and resource variants for improved 
performance. The plan is to provide tools to interogate these caches in the 3.1 timeframe.

These caches include:

<ul>
<li>Resource Variant cache
<li>SubsciberParticipant/SyncInfoSet
</ul>

<h3>CVS Specific data structures</h3>

CVS uses several caches to improve performance. Tools should be provided to query the
size of these caches as well.

<ul>
<li>Console (caches contents while not visible)
<li>Resource History View log entry cache
<li>Commit Sets log entry cache
</ul>
