<h3>Change Sets for incoming changes</h3>

To perform these scenarios you will need to get one or more projects 
in your workspace that have many incoming changes. Perferably
all the changes will have commit comments and some files will share
a comment. Once you have this setup, you can perform the following sub-scenarios.

<h4>Enabling/disabling Change Sets</h4>
<ol>
<li>Synchronize the projects with HEAD, enable change set mode and
ensure that the files appear in the proper change sets. Also ensure that 
the proper sub-layout is used by expanding some of the nodes in the tree.
<p>
<li>With some nodes expanded and additionally one or more selected, 
disable Change Sets. The same nodes should remain expanded and selected.
<p>
<li>With the same nodes selected and expanded, re-enable change sets.
The expansion should remain. There may be more expanded if the same
expanded project or folder appears in multiple change sets. The selection
will remain unless there are two entries for the same resource (i.e. if a project
was selected and it apears in multiple sets, it will no longer be expanded).
</ol>
You should also confirm that markers and conflicts are properly propogated to
parent nodes.
<h4>Change Set Layouts</h4>
Now try the various sub-layouts (Flat, Tree and Compressed) and ensure that switching
is performant and that the resulting tree nodes are correct.

<h4>Change Set Modes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Switch between the various modes and ensure that the displayed nodes are correct.
Also ensure that expansion and seleciton is maintained.
<li>Only Incomign and Outgoing mode shw change sets.
</ol>

<h4>Updating</h4>
With several nodes expanded, perform an update on one or more files
that are incoming changes.
Ensure that the updated files are removed from the view and that 
other expanded nodes remain expanded.

<h3>Outgoing  Sets</h3>

The following aspects of outgoing change sets should be tested.
<ol>
<li>Modified files can be added to a new or existing change set. Ensure that
when they are added, he file remains visible in the Sync view.
<li>Files in a change set can be transfered to another change set
<li>If there is a default change set, any modified file that is not already
part of a change set is placed in the default set. Files that are already
in a set should stay in that set if more changes are made to the files.
<li>The title and comment of a  change set can be changed.
<li>Layout and modes changes work properly for outgoing change sets in the
Synchronize view.
<li>ing one or more files in a change set will result in a commit 
dialog that is primed with the comment from the set.
<li>change sets (including which is the default), are preserved accross restarts.
</ol>
