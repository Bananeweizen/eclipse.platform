<p>Check the following for all cases of replace:
<ul>
<li>Decorators are updated in the navigator/packages view and synchronize view.
<li>If a version is loaded that you can't commit to it
<li>If a branch is loaded, that you can commit to it.
</ul>

<p>
Also ensure that the tag filtering in the dialog works properly.
