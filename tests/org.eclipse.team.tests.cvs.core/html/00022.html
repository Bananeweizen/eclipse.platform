<h3>Scenario 1: One Time Merge</h3>

<p>
Using Team>Merge, merge the changes from a branch into HEAD. Once completed, in the synchronize view, 
update the incoming changes, resolve any conflicts and ensure they worked, After updating, 
redo the same merge. A no-changes dialog should be 
presented since the local contents match the end-point.

<h3>Scenario 2: Ongoing Merge</h3>

After performing a one-time merge, pin the entry in the synchronize view. 
Release changes to the end point (branch) and synchronize the merge.
The new changes should appear in the synchronize view. Update to these
changes as appropriate.
 
<h3>Removing a Merge</h3>

<p>Delete the merge from the synchronize view using the remove toolbar button. The merge subscriber should be removed from the view.
