<p>You should be able to create a repo connection from the toolbar of the view or via the context menu. Try expanding, searching for branches. Also, 
try the failures cases from <a href="html/connections00001.html">Connections</a>.
Things to try:
<ul>
<li>Create repo locations for different connection types: ext, pserver, extssh.
<li>Expanding project nodes should process the children in the background and the view should remain responsive while this is happening. When children nodes are added to the 
tree the tree shouldn't be too jumpy.
</ul>
