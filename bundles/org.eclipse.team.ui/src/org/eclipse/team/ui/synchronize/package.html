<p>Application programming interfaces for interaction
with the Eclipse Synchronize View.</p>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>The Eclipse Team UI plug-in provides a set of classes and interfaces
to support a generic synchronize view that can show multiple
synchronize participants. This package contains a generic abstract
synchronize participant that provides the common functionality for
synchronize participants. The basic model for the Synchronize View APIs
is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ISynchronizeManager manages registered synchronize
participants. There can be several instances of the same participant
type.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant is a logical representation of a
connection between workspace resources and a remote location used to
shared those resources.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeView is a page book view of participants.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant must create a page that will be
displayed in the ISynchronizeView page book view.</li>
  <li>The ISynchronizeView shows a drop-down of all registered
participants and allows switching between them.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant can contribute actions to the toolbar,
menus, and view menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronize participants are declared by extending the <strong>synchronizeParticipants
</strong>extension point. There are two classes of synchronize
participants: <em>static </em>participants will be created when the
synchronize view is created, and <em>dynamic</em> participants that
are created by user code at some other time. A synchronize manager (<b>ISynchronizeManager</b>)
manages all active synchronize participants, and provides notification
of participants which are added and removed. Participants are displayed
in a page book view. Each participant implementation is reponsible for
creating its page (<b>IPageBookView</b>), which provides freedom of
presentation to the synchronize view implementation. A single
participant may be displayed simultaneously in multiple synchronize
views, and in different workbench windows.</p>

<p>This package contains classes that support displaying
synchronization information described by SyncInfo. If you consider the
synchronization model described by the classes in
org.eclipse.team.core.synchronize as the physical representation of
resource variants then the classes in this package allow you to control
how the model is presented to the user. One key feature of these APIs
is that they support managing dynamic models.<br>
</p>
<p>There is no specific support for the Synchronize View in this
package. Instead, the classes here can be used to build a page that can
be shown in the view, but they can also be used to show synchronization
information in dialogs, wizards, and editors.<br>
</p>
<p>The central abstractions for presenting synchronization state are:<br>
</p>
<p>- SynchronizeModelProvider, SynchronizeModelElement: are the
building blocks for
describing the logical structure of a synchronization model.<br>
- StructuredViewerAdvisor: are used to
display the logical structure to the user and define the basics such as
the SynchronizeModelProvider, label provider, and context menus.<br>
- SyncInfoCompareInput: is used to show a comparison between a local
resource and a variant in a compare editor.<br>
- SyncInfoSetCompareInput: is used to showing a set of variants in a
compare editor<br>
</p>
<p>Default implementations are provided and there are many levels of
customizations available.<br>
</p>
<h2>Basic Example</h2>
If you have a synchronization model described in a SyncInfoTree and
would like to show it to the user in a simple resource hierarchical
tree viewers you would:<br>
<br>
SyncInfoTree syncTree = getSyncTree();<br>
DiffTreeViewerConfiguration viewerConfiguration = new
DiffTreeViewerConfiguration(syncTree);<br>
TreeViewer viewer = new TreeViewer(parent);<br>
viewerConfiguration.initializeViewer(viewer);<br>
...<br>
viewerConfiguration.dispose();<br>
<br>
Some items of interest in the above example: (1) the viewer
configuration is used to add behavior to different types of tree
viewers and by default will build a hierarchical logical model of the
synchronization info and, (2) the default label provider will show the
nodes with resource decorations plus the standard diff change markers,
(3) the default context menu action is expand all plus any object
contributions.<br>
<br>
Another example, you would like to add additional label decorations,
and actions defined as viewerContribution in your plugin.xml.<br>
<br>
SyncInfoTree syncTree = getSyncTree();<br>
DiffTreeViewerConfiguration viewerConfiguration = new
DiffTreeViewerConfiguration("org.eclipse.team.example.actions",
syncTree) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected ILabelProvider getLabelProvider() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return new
SyncInfoLabelProvider.DecoratingColorLabelProvider(new
SyncInfoLabelProvider(), new MyCustorDecorator());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}<br>
TreeViewer viewer = new TreeViewer(parent);<br>
viewerConfiguration.initializeViewer(viewer);<br>
...<br>
viewerConfiguration.dispose();<br>
