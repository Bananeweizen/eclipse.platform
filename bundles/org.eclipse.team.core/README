Note to users of this plug-in

The classes and interfaces in this plug-in are part of an API that is 
still under development and expected to change significantly before 
reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to 
solicit feedback from pioneering adopters on the understanding 
that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken 
(repeatedly) as the API evolves.

For up-to-date information on these APIs and other related news see
