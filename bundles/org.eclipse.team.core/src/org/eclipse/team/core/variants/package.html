Application programming interfaces for accessing and managing resource variants. 
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>This package specifies the API for accessing and managing variants for local 
  workspace resources. The classes in this package can be used by Subscribers 
  (see the org.eclipse.team.core.subscribers package) or others. The classes are 
  roughly divided into three categories: <br>
</p>
<h3>Access to Resource Variants</h3>
<p>The following interfaces define the API required for subscribers to access 
  and manage variants of local resources.</p>
<ul>
  <li>IResourceVariant: provides access to information about a variant resource, 
    such as it's name, its type (file or container) and its contents.</li>
  <li>IResourceVariantComparator: supports the comparison of a local resource 
    with a variant or the comparison of two variants (if three-way comparison 
    is supported).</li>
  <li>IResourceVariantTree: provides access to a tree of locally cached resource 
    variants along with API to refresh the cached variants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementing Resource Variants</h3>
<p>Several classes are available that provide partial, extandable implementations 
  of the above mentioned interfaces.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CachedResourceVariant: an IResourceVariant implementation that supports 
    the caching of the contents of the variant. Subclasses must override to provide 
    fecthing of contents.</li>
  <li>AbstractResourceVariantTree: an IResourceVariantTree that contains logic 
    for performing a refresh of the cached resource variants. The caching mechanism 
    is delegated to subclasses as is the fetching of the resource variants.</li>
  <li>ResourceVariantTree: An AbstractResourceVariantTree that uses a ResourceVariantByteStore 
    to cache the resource variants. Subclasses must still provide the fecthing 
    of the remote state.</li>
  <li>ResourceVariantByteStore: An abstract class that defines the API required 
    for caching resource variants as byte arrays.</li>
  <li>PersistantResourceVariantByteStore: a ResourceVariantByteStore that persists 
    the bytes accross workbench invocations.</li>
  <li>SessionResourceVariantByteStore: a ResourceVariantByteStore that caches 
    the bytes in a session store and does not persist them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementing Subscribers</h3>
<p>The ResourceVariantTreeSubscriber class is a partial subscriber implementation 
  that makes use of the IResourceVariantTree interface to provide the remote and 
  base resesource management.</p>
