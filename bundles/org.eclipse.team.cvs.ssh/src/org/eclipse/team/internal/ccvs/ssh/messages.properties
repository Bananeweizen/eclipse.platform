Client.hostIdChanged=The server host key does not match the key previously stored.  Either the host key has changed or there is a man-in-the-middle attack. Contact the server administrator
Client.addedHostKey=Host key for {0} was not found in the list of known hosts stored in {1}. The key is being automatically added to the known_hosts file for you. When the Eclipse SSH client contacts a server that gives it a different key to the one mentioned in the known-hosts file, it will display a similar warning message. However, you should be aware that this situation is more serious from a security point of view; either the server's key has changed for a legitimate reason, or some machine is attempting to impersonate the server. Proceed with extreme caution.
