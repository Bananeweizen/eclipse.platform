<H2>About Red Dot Feature</H2>
<P>Our revolutionary Red Dot Eclipse feature changed all preconceptions about 
what Eclipse features can and cannot do. Using our strikingly simple concept of 
adding buttons to the Eclipse tool bar, we allow you to open dialogs that show 
you the version of the Red Dot feature. The beauty of the concept stems from its 
simplicity, ease of use, high performance and small footprint. Never before was 
it so easy to press a button on the tool bar to get some text shown in the 
dialog.</P>
