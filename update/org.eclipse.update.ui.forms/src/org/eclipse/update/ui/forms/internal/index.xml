Hello, world
</p>
<p>
This is a longer text that should show how I can present HTML-like
text. New lines 
should
not 
be 
presented within the paragraph. If the are, it is a 
<b>mistake</b>. We
can also demonstate IBM web site as http://www.ibm.com</p>
<p>

Now, whithin this text, <a href="link">a hyperlink!</a>.
