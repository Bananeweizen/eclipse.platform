Provides support for performing update operations.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package contains interfaces for creating and executing install and configuration
operations. In general, these operations are built on top of the primite operations 
defined by the org.eclipse.update.core and org.eclipse.update.configuration packages.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This package is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
(repeatedly) as the API evolves.
