/**
 * A launch wizard provides a UI for a launcher. It allows users
 * to configure launch specific attributes. A launch wizard is
 * is contributed by a launcher extension, via the <code>"wizard"</code>
 * attribute, which specifies the fully qualified name of the class that
 * implements this interface. 
 * <p>
 * A launch wizard can be instantiated in two ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When the run or debug button is pressed and a default launcher can
 *   not be determined for the current selection of active editor, the
 *   debug UI presents a composite wizard that allows the user to select a launcher 
 *   to use. When the next button is pressed, the wizard specified for that
 *   launcher is instantiated and displayed.</li>
 * </ul>When a launcher delegate is invoked, it has the option of displaying its
 *   wizard if the launcher delegate requires user interaction to configure a launch.</li>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to 
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback 
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
