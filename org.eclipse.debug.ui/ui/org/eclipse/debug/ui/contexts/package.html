<h2 align="left">Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides a set interfaces and classes relating to the active debug 
  context.</p>
<p>A debug context represents an active state of a program being debugged. The 
  active debug context drives the enabled state of debug actions (step, terminate, 
  etc.), source lookup, visible variables, watch expression values, etc. The debug 
  platform allows clients to register for context change notification in order 
  to respond to changes in the active debug state, as well as register context 
  providers that drive the active debug state. The debug platform has context 
  listeners and providers itself. For example, the debug platform's stepping actions 
  register for context change notification to update enabled state and the Debug 
  view registers as a context provider.</p>
