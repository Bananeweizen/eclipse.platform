<p>Application programming interfaces for interaction
with the Eclipse console.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The Eclipse platform UI console plug-in provides a set of classes and interfaces to
support a generic console. This package contains a generic abstract console that provides the common functionality
for consoles. Clients implementing consoles should subclass this <b>AbstractConsole</b>.</p>
<p>The classes <b>MessageConsole</b> and <b>MessageConsoleStream</b> provide an 
  implementation of a message console and message console stream that enables 
  logging of messages to a console.</p>
<p>A console manager (<b>IConsoleManager</b>) manages all active consoles, and 
  provides notification of consoles which are added and removed. Consoles are 
  displayed in a page book view. Each console implementation is reponsible for 
  creating its page (<b>IPageBookView</b>), which provides freedom of presentation 
  to the console implementation. A single console may be displayed simultaneously 
  in multiple console views, in different workbench windows.</p>
